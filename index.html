      <nav class="nav">

      <p>
        <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org"
          >I'm a link to an entirely different website.</a
        >
        Note how <strong>https://</strong> starts the href value.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="about.html"
          >I'm a link to a different page on the same website.</a
        >
        Note how there is NO https:// on my href. However, there needs to be an
        HTML file in your project that matches my href. For this example, I'd
        add a file called <strong>about.html</strong> to the same folder on my
        computer as my index.html. I could use a different folder, but the
        relative path must be correct.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="#box">I'm a link to a different part of the same page.</a>
        My href needs to match the <strong>ID</strong> of a different element on
        the page. Remember that no two elements on your site should have the
        same ID.
      </p>

    <footer class="contrast-text">
      <div id="get-down-here" class="footer center orange">
        My ID matches the one used in the link above. Capitalization matters!
