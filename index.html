    <!-- It's pretty common for the page's 'headline' and the navbar to be contained within a "header" element  -->
    <header class="blue">

        <a href="#get-down-here">

          <button title="Plain old button">Internal link: same page</button>

        <a href="about.html">
          <button class="bigger-button" title="Enlarged button">
            Internal link: different page, same site
          </button>

        <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org">

    <!-- Typically nav is outside and above main! -->
    <main>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org"
          >I'm a link to an entirely different website.</a
        >
        Note how <strong>https://</strong> starts the href value.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="about.html"
          >I'm a link to a different page on the same website.</a
        >
        Note how there is NO https:// on my href. However, there needs to be an
        HTML file in your project that matches my href. For this example, I've
        added a file called <strong>about.html</strong> to the
        <strong>same folder</strong> on my computer as my index.html. I could
        use a different folder, as long as the relative path to it is correct.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="#get-down-here"
          >I'm a link to a different part of the same page.</a
        >
        My href needs to match the <strong>ID</strong> of a different element on
        the page. Remember that no two elements on the page should have the same
        ID.
      </p>
    </main>

    <footer class="contrast-text">
      <div id="get-down-here" class="footer center orange">
        My ID matches the one used in the link above. Capitalization matters!
